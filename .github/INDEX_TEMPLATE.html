	<h1>Docspro</h1>
	<p>This repository provides information on the translation process of the Flask documentation, which will be conveniently used in some places in the Flask Community Work Group. As an extra, some badges are also provided to be used in the README.md to show the percentage.</p>

	<p>The information provided here is synchronized on a daily basis.</p>

	<p>Visit the <code>translation_data</code> branch to see all the files.</p>

	<p>This project is a small temporary whim and will be archived when the translation repositories are officially part of the Flask documentation.</p>
