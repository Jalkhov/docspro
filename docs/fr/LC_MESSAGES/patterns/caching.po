"When your application runs slow, throw some caches in.  Well, at least it's "
"the easiest way to speed up things.  What does a cache do?  Say you have a "
"function that takes some time to complete but the results would still be "
"good enough if they were 5 minutes old.  So then the idea is that you "
"actually put the result of that calculation into a cache for some time."

"Flask itself does not provide caching for you, but `Flask-Caching`_, an "
"extension for Flask does. Flask-Caching supports various backends, and it is"
" even possible to develop your own caching backend."
