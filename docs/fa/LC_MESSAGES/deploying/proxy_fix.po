"When using a reverse proxy, or many Python hosting platforms, the proxy will"
" intercept and forward all external requests to the local WSGI server."

"From the WSGI server and Flask application's perspectives, requests are now "
"coming from the HTTP server to the local address, rather than from the "
"remote address to the external server address."

"HTTP servers should set ``X-Forwarded-`` headers to pass on the real values "
"to the application. The application can then be told to trust and use those "
"values by wrapping it with the :doc:`werkzeug:middleware/proxy_fix` "
"middleware provided by Werkzeug."

msgid ""
"This middleware should only be used if the application is actually behind a "
"proxy, and should be configured with the number of proxies that are chained "
"in front of it. Not all proxies set all the headers. Since incoming headers "
"can be faked, you must set how many proxies are setting each header so the "
"middleware knows what to trust."

"Remember, only apply this middleware if you are behind a proxy, and set the "
"correct number of proxies that set each header. It can be a security issue "
"if you get this configuration wrong."
